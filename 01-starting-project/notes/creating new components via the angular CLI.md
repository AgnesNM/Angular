# Managing Components in Angular

## Organizing Components into Subfolders

As your Angular application grows, it's common to organize components into subfolders for better management. For example, create a `header` folder for the header component:

```
src/
  app/
    header/
      header.component.ts
      header.component.html
      header.component.css
```

After moving files, update the import path in `app.component.ts`:

```typescript
import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component';
```

## Using Angular CLI to Generate Components

Instead of manually creating component files, you can use Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate component user
# or the shortened version
ng g c user
```

This command creates a new `user` folder with component files:

```
src/
  app/
    user/
      user.component.ts
      user.component.html
      user.component.css
      user.component.spec.ts
```

The `user.component.ts` file will be automatically set up:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './user.component.html',
  styleUrl: './user.component.css'
})
export class UserComponent {

}
```

Note:
- The `selector` follows the naming convention.
- `standalone` is set to `true` by default.
- An empty `imports` array is included, which can be removed if not needed.
- The `user.component.spec.ts` file is for automated testing and can be deleted if not needed immediately.

This approach streamlines the process of creating new components while maintaining consistent file structure and naming conventions.
