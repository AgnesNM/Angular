# Building Components in Angular

Now that we understand how content appears on the screen and how the app component is loaded, it's time to work towards building our demo application. This will help us learn more about Angular and its features.

Looking at the finished demo application, we can see that it could be split into multiple components or UI building blocks:

- A header
- A sidebar with multiple elements (each could be a separate component)
- A main area on the right
- A dialog that opens when clicking "add task"

The idea in Angular is to build these individual components and then compose them together to create the overall UI.

## Creating a Header Component

Let's start by building the header component. We already have one component in our application - the app component, which is currently the only component on the screen. This component is made up of three files working together, which is standard in Angular.

To add a header component, we would typically create a new file named `header.component.ts`. The naming convention is:

```
[component-name].component.ts
```

In this file, we need to create a class that will be enhanced by the component decorator:

```typescript
export class HeaderComponent {
  // Class body (empty for now)
}
```

To convert this class into a component, we need to import the component decorator from Angular's core package and apply it to the class:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  // Component configuration goes here
})
export class HeaderComponent {
  // Class body (empty for now)
}
```

This structure - a TypeScript file with a class decorated by `@Component` - is the standard way to create components in Angular.

Certainly. Here's the formatted transcript, continuing from where we left off, with relevant code snippets in markdown:

## Configuring the Header Component

Now that we have our basic component structure, we need to configure it properly:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  standalone: true
})
export class HeaderComponent {
  // Class body (empty for now)
}
```

Let's break down the configuration:

### Selector

We define a selector that tells Angular which elements should be controlled or replaced by our component:

```typescript
selector: 'app-header'
```

The convention is to use at least two words separated by a dash. We use a prefix (like 'app-') to avoid clashing with built-in HTML elements.

### Template

For the template, we have two options:

1. Inline template (not recommended for complex templates):

```typescript
template: `
  <h1>Easy Task</h1>
`
```

2. External template file (recommended):

```typescript
templateUrl: './header.component.html'
```

We create a separate file named `header.component.html` in the same folder as our TypeScript file:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Easy Task</h1>
</header>
```

### Standalone Component

We add the `standalone` property and set it to `true`:

```typescript
standalone: true
```

This marks our component as a Standalone Component, which is easier to use and is the current recommendation for Angular development.

## Complete Header Component

Here's the complete `header.component.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  standalone: true
})
export class HeaderComponent {
  // Class body (empty for now)
}
```

And the corresponding `header.component.html` file:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Easy Task</h1>
</header>
```

With this setup, we've created a basic header component. The next step would be to learn how to use this component in our application.
